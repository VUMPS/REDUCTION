##Getting Started
This repository contains a convenience routine that sets up the IDL environment for the VUMPS reduction code. After installing the dependencies, update the vumpsr.sh file with the appropriate path information. Next, simply type `./vumpsr.sh` at the command line to start up the reduction code environment:

    ./vumpsr.sh
    Now setting the path to +/projects/VUMPS/REDUCTION/code:+/idl/mpfit:+projects/idlutils:+/idl:+/projects/IDLAstro/pro:+/projects/coyote:+/Applications/exelis/idl/lib
    Now changing the directory to: /projects/VUMPS/REDUCTION/code
