Reduction Code Quality Checks
=============================

This document describes the analysis and quality checks
of the VUMPS commissioning data taken on 150523 and 150524.

Additional flats
================

High SNR flats were not taken on 150524, but *were* taken on 150523. Unfortunately, many changes were made to the
Spectrometer during commissioning, and one cannot to certain
that flats taken on the 23rd will line up with spectra taken
on the 24th.

To ensure the flats line up, I wrote the routine ```compare_flats.pro`` to restore and project three separate exposures in the cross-dispersion direction: a flat taken on the 23rd, a flat taken on the 24th, and a solar spectrum taken with the lens on the fiber head on the 24th. Below is the result:

This plot shows that orders in the flats from the 23rd and 24th, and solar spectra from the 24th all line up well. I then copied the flats from the 23rd to the data directory for the 24th and renamed them so that they can be used by the reduction code:

::

    cp /raw/vumps/150523/vumps150523.103[2-9]*
    cp /raw/vumps/150523/vumps150523.10[4-6]*
    rename -v 's/vumps150523.10(\d+).fit/vumps150524.11$1.fit/' vumps150523.1*

These files were then added as new lines to the logsheet for 150524.
