#Reduction Code Quality Checks

This document describes the analysis and quality checks
of the VUMPS commissioning data taken on 150523 and 150524.

##Additional flats

High SNR flats were not taken on 150524, but *were* taken on 150523. Unfortunately, many changes were made to the
Spectrometer during commissioning, and one cannot to certain
that flats taken on the 23rd will line up with spectra taken
on the 24th.

To make sure this is the case, I restored a flat from the 23rd, and a solar spectrum and flat taken on the 24th and plotted projections in the cross-dispersion direction. Below are the results
